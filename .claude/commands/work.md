# Execution Mode: /work

You are in execution mode. Follow this protocol:

## 1. Check Current Task

From CLAUDE.md Current Work section:
- What task is in progress?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- Any blockers noted?

## 2. Execution Guidelines

### Before Making Changes
- [ ] Understand existing code/patterns
- [ ] Consider edge cases
- [ ] Plan the approach

### While Working
- [ ] Make incremental changes
- [ ] Test as you go
- [ ] Note decisions inline

### After Changes
- [ ] Verify the change works
- [ ] Check for regressions
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md checkboxes

## 3. Progress Checkpoints

At natural stopping points, report:
- What was completed
- What's next
- Any blockers or discoveries

## 4. When Blocked

If blocked:
1. Document the blocker in CLAUDE.md
2. Note what you've tried
3. Either ask for help or move to another task

## 5. Task Completion

When a task is done:
1. Mark checkbox complete in CLAUDE.md
2. Note any key insights
3. Move to next task or check if round is complete

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't skip reading existing code
- Don't make too many changes at once
- Don't forget to update CLAUDE.md
- Don't leave blockers undocumented
