# Planning Mode: /plan

You are entering planning mode for complex work. Follow this protocol:

## 1. Define the Problem

Before planning, clearly articulate:
- What are we trying to achieve?
- What constraints exist?
- What does success look like?

## 2. Consider an Expert Panel

If this is a new problem domain, consider running `/panel` first.

Ask: "Would an expert panel be valuable here? What pattern are we dealing with?"

## 3. Research Phase

- Explore relevant code/documentation
- Identify dependencies and constraints
- Note potential approaches

## 4. Create Plan File

Create a plan file in `/.claude/plans/`:
- Name format: `[adjective]-[verb]-[noun].md`
- Use the plan file template
- Document approach, phases, and success criteria

## 5. Review with User

Present the plan:
- High-level approach
- Key phases
- Risks and mitigations
- Success criteria

Ask: "Does this plan align with your expectations? Any adjustments needed?"

## 6. Exit Planning

Once approved, plan mode ends. Use `/work` to track execution.
