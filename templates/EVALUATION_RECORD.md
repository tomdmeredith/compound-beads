## Evaluation Results

| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| [Criterion 1] | [Target] | [Actual] | Pass/Fail | [Context] |
| [Criterion 2] | [Target] | [Actual] | Pass/Fail | [Context] |
| [Criterion 3] | [Target] | [Actual] | Pass/Fail | [Context] |

**Overall Result:** [Pass / Partial / Fail]

---

## What Worked

- [Success 1 - what and why]
- [Success 2 - what and why]
- [Success 3 - what and why]

---

## What Didn't Work

- [Failure 1 - what happened]
- [Failure 2 - what happened]
- [Failure 3 - what happened]

---

## Error Analysis

### Error 1: [Description]

**Observed Behavior:** [What actually happened]

**Expected Behavior:** [What should have happened]

**5 Whys Analysis:**
1. Why? → [First answer]
2. Why? → [Second answer]
3. Why? → [Third answer]
4. Why? → [Fourth answer]
5. Why? → [Root cause]

**Root Cause:** [The fundamental issue]

**Action Taken:** [What was done to fix it]

**Result:** [Did the fix work?]

---

### Error 2: [Description]

**Observed Behavior:** [What actually happened]

**Expected Behavior:** [What should have happened]

**5 Whys Analysis:**
1. Why? → [First answer]
2. Why? → [Second answer]
3. Why? → [Root cause found before 5]

**Root Cause:** [The fundamental issue]

**Action Taken:** [What was done to fix it]

**Result:** [Did the fix work?]

## Error Categories

| Category | Count | % of Errors | Priority |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Algorithm/Logic | [N] | [%] | [H/M/L] |
| Data Quality | [N] | [%] | [H/M/L] |
| Edge Cases | [N] | [%] | [H/M/L] |
| Performance | [N] | [%] | [H/M/L] |
| Integration | [N] | [%] | [H/M/L] |

**Focus Area:** [Largest category to address in next round]

## Traces (Optional - for complex debugging)

### Trace: [Specific failure case]

| Step | Action | Expected | Actual | Issue? |
|------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | [Action] | [Expected] | [Actual] | [Yes/No] |
| 2 | [Action] | [Expected] | [Actual] | [Yes/No] |
| 3 | [Action] | [Expected] | [Actual] | [Yes/No] |

**Failure Point:** Step [N]

**Root Cause:** [Why this step failed]

---

## Key Insight

---

## Recommendations for Next Round

1. **High Priority:** [Action based on critical failures]
2. **Medium Priority:** [Action based on marginal results]
3. **Low Priority:** [Optimization opportunities]

---

## Metrics to Track Going Forward

- [New metric to add based on learnings]
- [Existing metric to refine]
- [Metric to deprecate and why]
