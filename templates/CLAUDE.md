## Compound Beads Methodology

This project uses iterative "rounds" - each building on the previous like beads on a string.

### Core Pattern (5-Phase Cycle)
1. **Expert Panel** - Consult "irrelevant" experts for fresh perspectives
2. **Analysis** - Deep dive into problem space + define success criteria
3. **Implementation** - Build the solution
4. **Evaluation** - Measure against criteria, error analysis
5. **Documentation** - Capture learnings

### Round History (Summary)
| Round | Focus | Key Outcome |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Foundation] | [Outcome] |

### How to Start a New Round
1. Read CLAUDE.md for context
2. Define round goal clearly
3. Optionally convene expert panel
4. Implement and document
5. Update CLAUDE.md with accomplishments
